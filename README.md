# Social Robot for Austism
## Overview
Using a TurtleBot2, we have created a fully simulated environment where the robot can demonstrate various behaviors, interactions, and responses tailored to engaging with children and detect facial emotions. This aims to provide a personalized and adaptive learning experience, helping children develop communication, social cues recognition, and emotional regulation.

## Current Implementations 
- A Functioning Simulated Environment and Motion Controls
- Expressive Feedback through Motions
- Text-to-Speech Implementation
- Interactive Storytelling
## Future Implementations
- Expand TTS Capabilities and more human speech
- Collision Detection & Safety Measures
  - Using a LIDAR-based object detection
- Further Personalize Robot for User 
- Create more human interaction
- Allow for voice detection
- Interpret Gestures and Emotional Cues
## Long Term Vision
- Create a scalable application that can be transferred to a physical robot and continuously enhance the robot's ability to understand, respond, and adapt.
- Working with social workers and therapists to find the robot's capabilities.
